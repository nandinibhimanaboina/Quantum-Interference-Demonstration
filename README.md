# Quantum-Interference-Demonstration
#  Quantum Interference using Hadamard and Phase Gates

This project demonstrates constructive and destructive interference in quantum states.

---

##  Concept

A Phase gate inserted between two Hadamard gates alters probability amplitudes, leading to interference effects visible in measurement outcomes.

---

##  Circuit Description

1. Applied Hadamard gate to create superposition
2. Applied Phase (y) gate
3. Applied Hadamard gate again
4. Measured the qubit and observed probability changes
